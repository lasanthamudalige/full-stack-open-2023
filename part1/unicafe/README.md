## Overview

The **unicafe** project is a React application that allows users to give feedback on a caf√© by rating it with various metrics (good, neutral, bad). It then displays the collected feedback and computes simple statistics based on the ratings. 

The key objectives of this project are:

   * Learning how to manage state in React components.
   * Handling user inputs and events.
   * Displaying dynamic content based on user interactions.

## Prerequisites

   * Node.js (version 14 or higher)
   * npm or yarn package manager

Ensure that you have these installed before proceeding.

## Installation

   1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lasanthamudalige/full-stack-open-2023.git
   ```

   2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd full-stack-open-2023/part1/unicafe
   ```

   3. Install dependencies:

   If you are using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install # or 'npm i'
   ```

   Or, if you are using yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Usage

1. To run the application locally:

    Start the development server:

    ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Or if using yarn:
   ```bash
    yarn start
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

## Key Concepts

  * **State Management:** The app utilizes React's **useState** hook to manage the state of feedback ratings and statistics.

  * **Event Handling:** User interactions (such as button clicks) are managed using event handlers, which update the state accordingly.

  * **Dynamic Rendering:** The application dynamically renders content based on the current state, allowing users to see updated statistics as they interact with the app.
